# PORT-SCANNING-AND-FIREWALL-HARDENING
This project automatically scans for open TCP ports on a Windows system using Nmap and blocks them using Windows Defender Firewall. A PowerShell script handles the automation, and a batch file allows one-click execution. It helps improve system security by closing unused and potentially risky ports.
